## Notes
Looker doesn't support concurrent operations on their database. That's why we are required to limit parallelism to <b>1</b> during the applying of heavy operations with multiple user creations.
Here is how to do it:
```
terraform apply -parallelism=1
```
If parallelism is not limited, the Looker API may return <B>500 exceptions</b> for heavy operations.
