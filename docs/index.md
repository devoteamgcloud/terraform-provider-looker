# Looker Provider

The Looker provider provides resources to interact with a Looker instance API.

To use the Looker provider, you will need API credentials. These can be generated at `https://org.cloud.looker.com/admin/users` and come in the form of "API3 Keys": <abbr title="\b[a-zA-Z0-9]{20}\b">`client_id`</abbr> and <abbr title="\b[a-zA-Z0-9]{24}\b">`client_secret`</abbr>.
Ensure the user used as owner of the API keys has sufficient admin permissions.


## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    looker = {
      source  = "devoteamgcloud/looker"
      version = "0.0.0-dev"
    }
  }

}

provider "looker" {
  base_url      = "https://org.cloud.looker.com:19999/api/" # Optionally use env var LOOKER_BASE_URL
  client_id     = ""                                        # Optionally use env var LOOKER_API_CLIENT_ID
  client_secret = ""                                        # Optionally use env var LOOKER_API_CLIENT_SECRET
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- **base_url** (String) For base_url, provide the URL including /api/ ! Normally, a REST API should not have api in it's path, therefore we don't add the /api/ inside the provider.
- **client_id** (String)
- **client_secret** (String, Sensitive)
